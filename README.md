# Projects
This repository contains the projects I've done for my studies/projects I've done in my free time.

1. The first project concerns Winter and Summer Olympic games. In that project I explore how top countries performed in terms of amount of medals they've won, the amount of medals
they've won in each individual sport and whether countries performed better in winter in comparison to summer. The majoority of the project is concerned with data manipulation 
and utilises Pandas package and Seaborn package.
