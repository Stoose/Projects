# Projects
This repository contains the projects I've done for my studies/projects I've done in my free time. Under the folder "Images" you can find the main outputs from the projects. The folder "Notebooks" contain the projects themselves.

1. The first project concerns Winter and Summer Olympic games. In that project I explore how top countries performed in terms of amount of medals they've won, the amount of medals
they've won in each individual sport and whether countries performed better in winter in comparison to summer. The majoority of the project is concerned with data manipulation 
and utilises Pandas package and Seaborn package.

2. The second project is more related with the Risk Management and predicting the value of the portfolio. The main task was to find VaR and to conduct Monte Carlo simulation using both parametric approach and historical approach. 

3. The third project attempts to use Long short-term memory (LSTM) to derive a prediction for the portfolio price. The project required training the model and then applying it on
our data.
