# Projects
This repository contains the projects I've done for my studies/projects I've done in my free time. Under the folder "Images" you can find the main outputs from the projects. The folder "Notebooks" contain the projects themselves.

1. The first project concerns Winter and Summer Olympic games. In that project I explore how top countries performed in terms of amount of medals they've won, the amount of medals
they've won in each individual sport and whether countries performed better in winter in comparison to summer. The majority of the project is concerned with data manipulation 
and utilises Pandas package and Seaborn package.

2. The second project is  related with managing of the risk and predicting the value of the portfolio in the future. The main task was to find VaR and to conduct Monte Carlo simulation using both parametric approach and historical approach. 

3. The third project attempts to use Long short-term memory (LSTM) to derive a prediction for the portfolio price. During the project there will be a comparison done between regression model and LTSM models to see which one performs best. The model was trained using the historical data on the volume and the price data for each stock. Using the prediction a financial analyst could aid in an investment decision. 

4. The forth project invloves tangling information from social media (in this case Twitter) to gauge the level of enthusiasm people are showing in relation to one of the companies. This is accomplished by applying Natural language processing approach, which converts words into numbers. These numbers are then used to make predictions. This could be a useful tool when making buy/sell decision for a security.
